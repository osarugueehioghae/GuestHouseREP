            <h2>About Multipace</h2>
            <p>
                Multipace was founded with a simple but powerful vision, to create unique guest houses inspired by the stories and worlds that move us. 
                We believe spaces can tell stories, evoke emotions, and transport people beyond the ordinary.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our long-term goal is to expand and develop multiple guest houses, each inspired by different cinematic worlds and beloved films. 
                Every location will be carefully designed to reflect the atmosphere, emotion, and beauty of the story that inspired it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our first, and currently only guest house draws inspiration from the animated film Your Name. 
                The serene landscapes, peaceful mountain settings, and sense of connection portrayed in the movie deeply influenced our design. 
                We wanted to create a space that feels calm, meaningful, and slightly magical, 
                a place where guests can pause, reflect, and feel part of something special.
            </p>
            <p>
                At Multipace, we stand for creating spaces that merge hospitality with storytelling. 
                Our mission is to turn the feeling of your favorite movie scenes into real environments you can experience, stay in, and remember.
